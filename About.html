        <h2>My Experience in Programming, Electronics, and Microcontrollers</h2>
        <div class="experience-section">
            <h3>Programming</h3>
            <p>
                I have developed a strong foundation in programming languages, including C, Python, and JavaScript. My work with embedded systems and microcontrollers has allowed me to write efficient, low-level code for hardware applications. I am comfortable with various programming paradigms and enjoy solving complex problems that involve both hardware and software integration.

        <div class="experience-section">
            <h3>Computers & Electronics</h3>
            <p>
                Over the years, I have developed a deep understanding of computer architecture, hardware design, and troubleshooting. My experience ranges from building and optimizing PCs to designing and testing circuit boards. I have hands-on experience with various electronics components, from resistors and capacitors to more complex systems such as sensors and processors.

            <h3>Microcontrollers</h3>
            <p>
                Microcontrollers have been a core part of my work, and I specialize in working with platforms like Arduino, ESP32, and the popular Raspberry Pi. I have designed multiple projects that involve interfacing sensors, motors, displays, and other peripherals. My work includes building custom firmware and integrating microcontrollers into larger systems, often with wireless connectivity and IoT features.

            <h3>Focus on nice!nanos</h3>
            <p>
                One of my recent projects revolves around the nice!nanos keyboard, which is a customizable and open-source mechanical keyboard. I have been involved in the development and firmware programming for this project, specifically focusing on enhancing the ergonomics, keymap customization, and improving the overall user experience. The nice!nanos is designed with flexibility in mind, and I have contributed by fine-tuning its firmware to allow for a seamless integration of features such as layers, macros, and dynamic key lighting.
            </p>
            <p>
                My work with nice!nanos also extends to community involvement, where I have shared my designs and code with the open-source community. I strongly believe in the value of collaborative development and have worked with others to create innovative and functional keyboard layouts.
